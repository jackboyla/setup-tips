If you're using Visual Studio Code's Remote - SSH extension and need `gcloud compute config-ssh` to work, but are currently blocked due to permissions, a workaround is to manually configure SSH for your Google Cloud VM instances. This involves a few steps:

### 1. Generate an SSH Key Pair

First, ensure you have an SSH key pair. If you don't already have one, you can generate it using:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/gcloud-ssh-key -C your-email@example.com
```

Replace `your-email@example.com` with your email. This command generates a new SSH key pair (`gcloud-ssh-key` and `gcloud-ssh-key.pub`) in your `~/.ssh` directory.

### 2. Add Your Public Key to the GCP Instance

1. **Open the Google Cloud Console** and navigate to your VM instance.
2. **Edit the instance** and scroll down to the SSH Keys section.
3. **Add a new SSH key**. Open your public key file (`gcloud-ssh-key.pub`) in a text editor, copy its contents, and paste them into the SSH keys section in the Google Cloud Console.

### 3. Configure SSH in VS Code

In Visual Studio Code, you'll need to manually configure the SSH connection:

1. **Open the SSH Configuration File** in VS Code (Command Palette â†’ `Remote-SSH: Open Configuration File`).
2. **Add a New Host**. Add an entry for your GCP instance like this:

   ```ssh
   Host jack-gcp-instance
       HostName [EXTERNAL_IP_OF_YOUR_INSTANCE]
       User [USERNAME]
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gcloud-ssh-key
   ```

   Replace `[EXTERNAL_IP_OF_YOUR_INSTANCE]` with the external IP address of your GCP VM and `[USERNAME]` with the username associated with your SSH key (usually your email prefix).

### 4. Connect Using VS Code

- Use the Remote-SSH extension in VS Code to connect to `jack-gcp-instance`. This will use the SSH configuration you just set up.

### 5. Optional: Update Local SSH Config

For convenience, you can also update your local SSH config file (`~/.ssh/config`) with the same host entry you added to VS Code. This allows you to SSH into your GCP instance from the terminal using the host alias:

```bash
ssh gcp-instance
```

### Note:

- This workaround bypasses the need for `gcloud compute config-ssh` and project-wide SSH key configuration, relying instead on instance-specific SSH keys.
- Ensure your GCP instance's firewall rules allow SSH connections (usually on port 22).
- When you get the necessary permissions, it's recommended to use `gcloud compute config-ssh` for a more streamlined SSH setup.
